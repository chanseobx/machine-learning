### types of machine learning
  - supervised      vs unsupervised
  - parametric      vs nonprametric
  - batch           vs online learning
  - discriminative  vs generative
### probability
  - random variable: 표본공간 내에 있는 각 원소에 하나의 실수값을 대응시키는 함수
    - discrete random variable
      - PMF, probability mass function
    - continuous random variable
      - CDF, cumulative distribution function
      - PDF, probability density function
  - 확률 분포: random variable에 대해서 확률을 표현해 주는 것
  - joint probability
  - conditional probability
    - bayses rule
      - bayses concept learning, maximum a posterior
        - Q. Should you work hard to get A+? VS If you work hard, can you get A+? (These think is base rate fallacy error)

        - Q. Why we confuse this question?
        - A. because almost no difference beteweeen rate of get A+ in work hard and of get work hard and correlate in get A+ in reality

        (if likelyhood not exist, use correlation, maximum likelyhood)
